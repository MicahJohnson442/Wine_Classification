# Wine_Classification
Wine experts can identify wines from specific vineyards through smell and taste, but the factors that give different wines their
individual characteristics are actually based on their chemical composition. Wine is a complex mixture of chemical compounds in 
a hydro-alcoholic solution with a pH around 4. The chemistry of wine and its resultant quality depend on achieving a balance between 
three aspects of the berries used to make the wine: their sugar content, acidity and the presence of secondary compounds. 

Concentration and levels, that were used as the features were Alcohol, Malic Acid, Ash, Alcalinity, Magnesium, Phenols, Flavanoids,
Nonflavanoids, Proanthocyanines, Color Intensity, Hue, Proline, and Wine Variety.  

In this project, I trained a classification model to analyze the chemical and visual features of wine samples and classified them based on their cultivar (grape variety).
